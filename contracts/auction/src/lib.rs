//! This is an example auction smart contract.
//!
//! The auction sells tokens of one type for another (can be the same token type).
//!
//! The contract works by escrowing bids as well as the tokens for sale.
//! This is done through `transfer` calls to the token contracts with
//! callbacks ensuring that the transfers were successful.
//! If a bid is not the current highest bid the transferred bidding tokens can
//! be claimed during any phase.
//!
//! The auction has a set `duration`. After this duration the auction no longer accepts bids and can
//! be executed by anyone. Once `execute` has been called the contract moves the tokens for sale
//! into the highest bidders claims and the highest bid into the contract owners claims.
//!
//! In the bidding phase any account can call `bid` on the auction which makes a token `transfer`
//! from the bidder to the contract. Once the transfer is done the contract updates its
//! highest bidder accordingly.
//!
//! The contract owner also has the ability to `cancel` the contract during the bidding phase.
//! If cancel is called the highest bid is taken out of escrow such that the highest bidder can
//! claim it again. The same is done for the tokens for sale which the contract owner
//! then can claim.
